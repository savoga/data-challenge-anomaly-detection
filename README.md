# Data Challenge - Anomaly Detection

This is a university project in the form of a data challenge that I did during my data science degree at Télécom Paris.

## Context

The data set is provided by Airbus and consists of the measures of the accelerometer of helicopters during 1 minute at frequency 1024 Hertz, which yields time series measured at in total 60 * 1024 = 61440 equidistant time points.

## Data

#### Training data

The training set consists of one file, airbus_train.csv.

File airbus_train.csv contains one observation per row, each observation having 61440 entries, measures with equivalent time distance of 1 / 1024 seconds.

There are in total 1677 training observations.

#### Test data

The training set consists of one file, airbus_test.csv, which has the same structure as file airbus_train.csv.

There are in total 2511 test observations.

## 1. Data exploration

## 2. Data analysis
